pdf analysis of air force forms

One of the most pointless and time-consuming things that Air Force officer and enlisted personnel do every year is bullet-writing. 

Air Force personnel typically are required to write bullets for performance reports and award packages. 

AF bullets follow a few formatting rules:

- Each bullet must be exactly one line, with the width of the line depending on the form (performance report, award package, etc).
- Acronyms and abbreviations are organization/commander-specific. Organizations are highly inconsistent with their abbreviation/acronym policies.

Those formatting rules lead to the following

- Information compression is prioritized over legibility
- Time is wasted on acronym/abbreviation revision
- Bullet "appearance" becomes highly valued; some examples of arbitrary bullet appearance rules:
  - any sort of repetition = bad
  - bullets near flush with page boundaries = good

The purpose of this repository is to develop a set of tools to automate the pointless aspects of bullet-writing so that an officer/enlisted member can focus more on writing actual content rather than worry about irrelevant formatting.
